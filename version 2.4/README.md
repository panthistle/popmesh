### Usage

The best way to find out what the add-on can do for you is to experiment with it.  All the command buttons,  
selection lists, etc., in the user-interface include tooltips describing their function.  If you are comfortable  
using Blender, you should not have any problems.  There is also a [User Guide](https://panthistle.github.io/pdfs/PopMeshGuide.pdf) that provides detailed information  
about the program with illustrated examples.
