### Help

I believe the best way to find out what the addon can do for you is to experiment with it. All the command buttons,  
selection lists, etc., in the user-interface include tooltips describing their functionality. If you are comfortable  
using Blender, you will not have any problems. Of course, there may be some things that need further explaining and  
to that end I have posted the following video on YouTube, where I demonstrate basic usage and some of the features.
