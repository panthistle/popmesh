### About

'Pop Mesh' is the first of three 'path-on-path' addons for Blender I wrote over the past few months. They all share  
the same core script though there are siginificant differences in their implementation as they deal with different  
tasks and object types. All three addons have been tested with Blender 2.93 LTS.


### Download and Installation

To download 'Pop Mesh':  
- Click on the green 'Code' button above and select the 'Download ZIP' option
- Save the 'popmesh-main.zip' file to your hard drive  

To install the addon in Blender:
- Extract the 'popmesh-main.zip' archive
- There will be three files inside the the extracted folder: 'LICENSE', 'PTDBLNPOPM.zip' and 'README.md'
- In Blender, open the 'Preferences...' window from the 'Edit' menu
- In the 'Add-ons' tab, click 'Install...', navigate to the 'PTDBLNPOPM.zip' file, select it and click 'Install Add-on'
- Enable the addon


### Help

I believe the best way to find out what an addon can do for you is to experiment with it. All the command buttons,  
selection lists, etc., in the user-interface include tooltips describing their functionality. If you are comfortable  
using Blender, you will not have any problems. Of course, there may be some things that need further explaining and  
to that end I have posted the following video on YouTube, where I demonstrate basic usage and some of the features.
