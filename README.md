### Help

The best way to find out what the addon can do for you is to experiment with it. All the command buttons,  
selection lists, etc., in the user-interface include tooltips describing their functionality. If you are comfortable  
using Blender, you should not have any problems. Of course, there may be some things that need further  
explaining and to that end I have posted the following video on YouTube, where I demonstrate basic usage  
and some of the features.
